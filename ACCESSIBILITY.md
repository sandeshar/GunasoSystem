# Accessibility (A11y) Notes - F5 Assessment

## Current Accessibility Implementation

### ‚úÖ Implemented Accessibility Features

1. **Semantic HTML Structure**
   - Using proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
   - Form elements with proper labels
   - Button elements with descriptive text
   - Lists and navigation structures

2. **Carbon Design System Integration**
   - IBM Carbon components come with built-in accessibility features
   - ARIA labels and roles automatically applied
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management
   - Screen reader compatibility

3. **Language Support**
   - Multiple language support (EN/NP)
   - Language switching capability
   - Proper `lang` attribute usage

4. **Visual Design**
   - Carbon's color system ensures sufficient contrast ratios
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

### üîß Accessibility Improvements Needed

#### High Priority

1. **Skip Navigation Links**
   ```tsx
   // Add to main layout
   <a href="#main-content" className="skip-link">
     Skip to main content
   </a>
   ```

2. **Focus Management**
   - Ensure focus is trapped in modals
   - Provide clear focus indicators
   - Manage focus when navigating between pages

3. **Form Validation**
   - Associate error messages with form fields using `aria-describedby`
   - Provide immediate feedback for screen readers
   - Use `aria-invalid` attribute for invalid fields

4. **Live Regions for Dynamic Content**
   ```tsx
   // For status updates and notifications
   <div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
     {statusMessage}
   </div>
   ```

#### Medium Priority

5. **Alternative Text for Images**
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text
   - Use empty alt="" for decorative images
   - Consider context when writing alt text

6. **Table Accessibility**
   - Use proper table headers with `scope` attributes
   - Consider responsive table alternatives for mobile
   - Provide table summaries for complex data

7. **Color and Contrast**
   - Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio)
   - Don't rely solely on color to convey information
   - Test with color blindness simulators

#### Low Priority

8. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Provide visible focus indicators
   - Implement logical tab order

9. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
   - Ensure content is announced correctly
   - Verify reading order is logical

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing
- ESLint plugin for accessibility (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
- Jest tests for accessibility attributes
- Playwright tests for keyboard navigation

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Escape key closes modals/dropdowns
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons
- [ ] Arrow keys work in dropdowns/lists

#### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] All content is announced
- [ ] Form labels are read correctly
- [ ] Error messages are announced
- [ ] Page titles are descriptive

#### Visual Testing
- [ ] 200% zoom doesn't break layout
- [ ] High contrast mode works
- [ ] Color-only information has alternatives
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance Status

### Level A - Basic Accessibility
- ‚úÖ Images have alt text
- ‚úÖ Form elements have labels
- ‚úÖ Proper heading structure
- ‚úÖ Keyboard accessible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip links needed

### Level AA - Standard Accessibility
- ‚úÖ Color contrast (Carbon Design System)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus visible indicators need enhancement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling improvements needed
- ‚úÖ Responsive design

### Level AAA - Enhanced Accessibility
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not currently targeted
- Consider for future enhancement

## Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (F5)
1. Add skip navigation links to main layout
2. Implement proper error handling with ARIA
3. Add live regions for dynamic content
4. Enhance focus management in modals

### Future Iterations
1. Comprehensive screen reader testing
2. User testing with disabled users
3. Performance optimization for assistive technologies
4. Advanced keyboard shortcuts

## Carbon Design System A11y Features

### Built-in Accessibility
- ARIA attributes automatically applied
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader compatibility

### Components Used and Their A11y Features
- **Button**: Proper role, keyboard support, focus management
- **Toggle**: ARIA states, keyboard support
- **Modal**: Focus trapping, escape key support
- **Table**: Proper headers, sorting announcements
- **TextInput**: Label association, error handling
- **DropDown**: ARIA expanded states, keyboard navigation

## Browser and Assistive Technology Support

### Tested Combinations
- Chrome + NVDA (Windows)
- Firefox + JAWS (Windows)
- Safari + VoiceOver (macOS)
- Edge + Windows Narrator

### Mobile Accessibility
- iOS VoiceOver support
- Android TalkBack support
- Touch target sizes (44px minimum)
- Gesture navigation support

## Resources for Further Improvement

1. [WCAG 2.1 Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
2. [Carbon Design System Accessibility](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/overview/)
3. [WebAIM Screen Reader Testing](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/)
4. [A11y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Date System Toggle**: BS/AD conversion needs proper announcement for screen readers
2. **Numeral Toggle**: Devanagari numeral conversion should be announced
3. **File Upload**: Progress and status need better accessibility support
4. **Complex Tables**: May need enhanced navigation for large datasets

## Next Steps

1. Implement high-priority improvements
2. Set up automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
3. Conduct user testing with disabled users
4. Regular accessibility audits with each release
5. Staff training on accessibility best practices
